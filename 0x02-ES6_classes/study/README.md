# Notes

A class is defined with the keyword __class__
A class could either be a __class expression__ or __class declaration__

static keyword is used in defining static fields and static methods

static properties(fields and methods) are defined on the class itself instead of the instance. Referencing static properties from an instance returns __undefined__

static methods are often used in creating utility functions for applications while static fields are useful for caches, fixed configurations, or any other data that wont be replicated across the instances.
