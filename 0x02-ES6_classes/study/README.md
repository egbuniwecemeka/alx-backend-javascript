# Notes

A class is defined with the keyword __class__
A class could either be a class expression or class declaration

static keyword is used in defining static fields and static methods

static properties(fields and methods) are defined on the class itself instead of the instance.

static methods are often used in creating utility functions for applications while static fields are useful for caches, fixed configurations, or any other data that wont be replicated across the instances.
